# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation using Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

The objective of this report is to develop a customer segmentation of active credit card users
for a certain bank in order to define an efficient marketing strategy. This project is an example of
unsupervised machine learning since we do not have a target variable. Therefore, we aim to
segment our dataset into different clusters from which we can develop effective marketing
campaigns based on the various features that reflect customer behavior.

In this report, we used two clustering algorithms, namely K-Means and silhouette
Clustering, to segment active credit card customers of a certain bank into three different clusters.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to bring down the dimensionality of the dataset so
that we obtain more efficient and predictive models.
